.. java:type:: public class ObjectiveInstance extends Instance<Objective>

   Represents an objective instance.

   All AMPL suffixes for an objective are available through methods with the same name in this class. See http://www.ampl.com/NEW/suffbuiltin.html for a list of the available suffixes.

   All the accessors in this class throw a :java:ref:`IllegalStateException` if the instance has been deleted in the underlying AMPL interpreter.

Methods
-------

.. java:method:: public String astatus()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Return the AMPL status

.. java:method:: public void drop()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Drop this objective instance

.. java:method:: public int exitcode()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Exit code returned by solver after most recent solve with this objective

.. java:method:: public String message()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Result message returned by solver after most recent solve with this objective

.. java:method:: public void restore()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Restore this objective instance (if it had been dropped, no effect otherwise)

.. java:method:: public String result()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance

   Result string returned by solver after most recent solve with this objective

.. java:method:: public String sstatus()
   :outertype: ObjectiveInstance
